## Features
- Modular routing structure
- Error handling using `http-errors`
- Logging with `morgan`
- View rendering with `pug`
- Cookie parsing with `cookie-parser`

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **Pug**: Templating engine

### Middleware:
- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger
- **Cookie-Parser**: Parses cookies in requests
- **Http-Errors**: Error handling module

### Other Dependencies:
- **Child Process**: For executing shell commands
- **Debug**: Debugging utility
